# hello-world
Hello, 

Just exploring github, I just finished MITx's Intro to CS and Programming with Python. Really like Python. Only previous coding experience was html in middle school with my neopet's homepage. Just started Hardvardx intro to CS. Learning C, it's not as easy but I really like do-while loops, seems like they're missing in python. Oh... and I'm a canadian stay at home mom of 3 girls. Weird bird aye? You don't know the half of it!
